**R-Type: Reborn** is a modern reimagining of the classic arcade shoot 'em up, combining nostalgic gameplay with new features and enhancements.

This project is divided into two key components:
- [**Stellar Forge**](https://github.com/epitech-mirroring/Stellar-Forge) : The game engine powering R-Type: Reborn.
- [**Orion Editor**](https://github.com/epitech-mirroring/Orion-Editor): The game editor used to create and modify game levels and assets.

## Project Purpose

Welcome to **R-Type: Reborn**, a project developed as part of the Advanced C++ knowledge unit at EPITECH. This initiative introduces networked video game development while pushing the boundaries of advanced programming techniques and promoting best practices in software engineering.

Our goal is to create a multithreaded server and a graphical client for the iconic **R-Type** game, using a game engine designed entirely by us.

Through **R-Type: Reborn**, we aim to offer a modern take on a classic game while applying cutting-edge C++ techniques in a networked gaming environment.

The purpose of **R-Type: Reborn** is also to modernize the classic R-Type experience, bringing new graphics, levels, and game mechanics while maintaining the core gameplay that made the original famous. This project also serves as a demonstration of the **Stellar Forge** engine and **Orion Editor**.
