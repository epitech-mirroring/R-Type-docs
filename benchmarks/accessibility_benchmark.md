# Accessibility Solutions Benchmark for Horizontal Shmup Game: R-Type

## Overview

This benchmark report compares the impact of several accessibility solutions, with the goal of assessing their suitability for integration into a 2D game.

The purpose of this benchmark is to identify solutions that can enhance the gaming experience for players with diverse needs while also considering the feasibility of implementation. By evaluating both the effectiveness (in terms of the population impacted) and the difficulty of integrating these solutions, we aim to strike a balance between accessibility and development effort.

This benchmark will help guide decisions on which features to prioritize in order to create a more inclusive and enjoyable game for all players.

## Categories
This study benchmarks the following categories:
- **Auditory Accessibility**: Solutions to assist players with hearing impairments or auditory processing difficulties.
- **Visual Accessibility**: Solutions for players with vision impairments, including color blindness or sensitivity to visual elements.
- **Physical Accessibility**: Solutions to assist players with mobility or physical impairments.
- **Cognitive Accessibility**: Solutions for players with cognitive challenges, including difficulty with processing speed or heightened sensitivity to certain stimuli.

## 1. Auditory Accessibility

### Subtitles (Change Fonts, Size, and Color)
- **Implementation Difficulty**: 3/5
  - Font size and color changes should be done through UI settings, and subtitles must dynamically adapt to game events.
- **Population Impact**: 5-6% (hearing impairment)
  - Affects both deaf and hard-of-hearing players as well as those with auditory processing disorders.

### Audio Descriptions of Sounds
- **Implementation Difficulty**: 2/5
  - Requires real-time generation or scripting of text/audio descriptions for sound-based cues.
- **Population Impact**: 5-6% (hearing impairment)
  - Mostly beneficial for players with severe to profound hearing loss or auditory impairments.

## 2. Visual Accessibility

### Adjustable HUD Size
- **Implementation Difficulty**: 2/5
  - Fairly simple to adjust in most game engines via scaling and resolution adaptation.
- **Population Impact**: 3-4% (visual impairments)
  - Useful for players with low vision or who struggle to track fast-moving elements.

### Colorblind Filters (Colorimetry / Contrast Adjustments)
- **Implementation Difficulty**: 4/5
  - Requires shaders or filters to adjust specific color spectrums, depending on the type of color blindness (e.g., deuteranopia, protanopia).
- **Population Impact**: ~8% (colorblind population)
  - Helps colorblind individuals better distinguish between visual elements.

### Flash Limitation (Reduce Intense Flashes)
- **Implementation Difficulty**: 2/5
  - Limiting flashes can be done by adding conditional checks or timers before rendering bright flashes.

  - Important for players with different motor needs or those using alternative controllers.

### One-Press Actions Instead of Holding (Quick Time Event Modification)
- **Implementation Difficulty**: 3/5
  - Requires changing input logic to respond to single presses for continuous actions.
- **Population Impact**: ~7% (motor impairments)
  - Helps players with limited dexterity or endurance by reducing the need for sustained input.

### One-Handed Control Configuration
- **Implementation Difficulty**: 4/5
  - Requires the creation of alternative input schemes or controllers for one-handed play.
- **Population Impact**: ~7% (motor impairments)
  - Supports individuals with disabilities affecting one side of the body or those with temporary injuries.

## 4. Cognitive Accessibility

### Difficulty Levels
- **Implementation Difficulty**: 1/5
  - Simple adjustments to enemy health, damage, or speed, already common in most games.
- **Population Impact**: ~10% (various cognitive challenges)
  - Beneficial for a range of players who prefer different levels of challenge based on skill or cognitive processing.

### Sensitive Mode (Remove Jumpscares)
- **Implementation Difficulty**: 2/5
  - Can be done by toggling certain game events (jumpscares) off in a "sensitive mode."
- **Population Impact**: ~8% (anxiety, PTSD)
  - Helpful for players who suffer from anxiety, PTSD, or similar conditions.

### Content Warnings
- **Implementation Difficulty**: 1/5
  - Simple implementation; content warnings are displayed before certain scenes or events.
- **Population Impact**: ~10%
  - Helps players with emotional or mental health issues prepare for triggering content.

### Adjustable Game Speed
- **Implementation Difficulty**: 2/5
  - As it affects game physics, timings, and interactions; requires thorough testing, but only requires changes in the game's tick management.
- **Population Impact**: ~10% (various cognitive conditions)
  - Useful for players who may process information at different speeds or prefer slower-paced gameplay.

## Conclusion
This benchmark outlines both the complexity of implementing various accessibility solutions and their potential impact on the player base. To ensure that the game is accessible to as many players as possible, it is essential to implement at least one solution from each category: **Auditory**, **Visual**, **Physical**, and **Cognitive**. 

Prioritizing solutions with lower implementation difficulty but higher potential impact, such as **subtitles**, **adjustable HUD size**, **custom control binding**, and **difficulty levels**, is an effective strategy to achieve broad accessibility. These options are relatively simple to implement and would benefit a significant portion of the player base.

However, integrating more complex solutions, such as **audio descriptions**, **one-handed control configuration**, or **adjustable game speed**, would enhance the game's inclusivity and provide a more robust experience for players with specific needs. Striking a balance between ease of implementation and depth of accessibility is key to ensuring the game is both playable and enjoyable for a diverse audience.
